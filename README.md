# Final_Project

I started the semester with a project called [It Sat](http://www.natepadgett.com/2017/02/10/it-sat/),
which modified a poem call "Instead of Bad News about a Person I Love" by Jack Underwood. In it, a narrator lacking a firm grasp of reality says increasingly outlandish things, giving the reader reason to think that something may be wrong with them. I interpreted this "something wrong"  a one of three possibilities:

1. The narrator was mentally unstable
2. The narrator was an older person suffering from dementia
3. There is nothing wrong. The narrator is a child. 

Though for It Sat I focused on possibility one and the presence of an "other", the potential that the narrator had dementia kept my interest. My grandmother has severe dementia and I watched her decline rapidly over the past year. Carrying for her has taken a significant portion of my and my family's time, so this "demented perspective" is quite personal. 

For my final RWET project, I would like to return to exploring the fractured, scrambled, and seemingly senseless way in which someone experiencing dementia or a decline into it communicates. 

I'm envisioning this as two main parts: 

1. 1-10 original letters "written" over the course of a year from the perspective of someone with dementia as source text
2. A python script or collection of scripts that transform the text of the letters, signifying decline of verbal and written communication as the disease progresses

I've though of two approaches to the source text:

1. A single letter that deteriorates 5-10 times. This approach will be the clearest illustration of the decline because the reader can compare each iteration. 
2. Multiple unique letters. This is more believable and allows for character development.

Ideally I would like the deterioration of the text to resemble Flowers for Algernon, a story about a man who achieves incredible intelligence from crippling learning disabilities, only to slip back into his original state.

As for the script, I'm still working on the rules for the text transformation and how to implement it. There is a lot of [research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2016.00060/full) into how the brain reacts to dementia, much of which uses hidden Markov Chains for analysis, but very little on how dementia affects speech. Finding this research will be a large portion of this project.
