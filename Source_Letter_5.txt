Merry Christmas & Happy New Year
											12/27/2016
Dear Friends and Family,

2016 will go down as the year full of too many unhappy events for our family and friends.  But, since we strive to be “half full” people, we want to focus on our blessings and there are many.  We have each other and we have wonderful friends.  We have sunshine most of the year and rain has made us see green again.  We have good health, we have experienced fun travels, and we have had many family gatherings.  Our souls have been fed and we are thankful.

Nathan will be home for three whole weeks, a long visit not enjoyed by us since UCSB.  He still resides in New York; working for a start up, living in Brooklyn, and is now attending graduate school.  He is super busy and energized.

Harry started a new choir in January. It is a joint venture with his high school choir director. The choir is off to a great start with two concert seasons booked already. Harry’s time with the choir will be short as he will move to Texas in January to start a new job.  Mom will be shedding a lot of tears while trying to be supportive.

Stephan continues to juggle college and work, including a summer internship with our county DA’s office.  In addition, he too joined the choir started by his brother Harry.  November 30th he submitted his applications to transfer to a university.  He has a few more applications to submit, but by Fall 2017, mom and dad anticipate being real empty nesters – oh my!

Nancy and Daniel continue to work together, trying to stay on top of all the changes in medicine.  They have been blessed with a great team.

We hope 2017 will bring good tidings for all.

Frohe Weinachten!
with love from our family to yours
