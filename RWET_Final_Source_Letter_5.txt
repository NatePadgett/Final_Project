Merry Christmas & Happy New Year
								 			 12/1/2015

Dear Friends and Family,

As the world seems to be increasingly full of craziness, it is important for us to seek strength in our family, friends, and faith.  We are endeavoring to learn more about our enemies knowing it is important to acknowledge and understand them in order to protect our precious family.  Updates on that precious family:

Nathan arrives on December 19th for two whole weeks! Yippee!  He still resides in New York, working near Time Square and living in a new, roomier apartment in Brooklyn.

Harry is eagerly assisting us with holiday preparations – so appreciated! He continues to work in the technology industry while living at home saving money for his own place one day – hard to accomplish in California!

Stephan busily juggles college and work.  He looks forward to a new opportunity to sing in choir again starting early 2016. More on that to come.

Daniel finds himself coming and going between hospital rounds and his clinic.  He is re-energized by periodic trips and outings with his boys.

Nancy escapes on those trips with Daniel in order to counter the pressures of managing Dr. Daniel’s practice, especially coping with with the ever changing reimbursement routines of medicine.


Frohe Weinachten!
Good cheer and good health to you in 2016, with love from our family to yours.
