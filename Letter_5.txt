Dear Friends and Family,

Our souls have been fed and we are thankful.

He is super busy and energized.

Harry started a new choir in January. It is a joint venture with his high school choir director. The choir is off to a great start with two concert seasons booked already. Harryâ€™s time with the choir will be short as he will move to Texas in January to start a new job.

November 30th he submitted his applications to transfer to a university.

Nancy and Stephan continue to work together, trying to stay on top of all the changes in medicine.

We hope 2017 will bring good tidings for all.

Frohe Weinachten!
with love from our family to yours
