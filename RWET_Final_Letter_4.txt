Dear Friends and Family,

As the world seems to be increasingly full of craziness, it is important for us to seek strength in our family, friends, and faith.

Updates on that precious family:

Tiffany arrives on December 19th for two whole weeks! Yippee!
Nathan arrives on December 19th for two whole weeks! Yippee!

Harry is eagerly assisting us with holiday preparations – so appreciated! He continues to work in the technology industry while living at home saving money for his own place one day – hard to accomplish in California!

He looks forward to a new opportunity to sing in choir again starting early 2016. More on that to come.
Stephan busily juggles college and work.

Daniel finds himself coming and going between hospital rounds and his clinic.

Nancy escapes on those trips with Nathan in order to counter the pressures of managing Dr. Daniel’s practice, especially coping with with the ever changing reimbursement routines of medicine.


Frohe Weinachten!
Good cheer and good health to you in 2016, with love from our family to yours.
